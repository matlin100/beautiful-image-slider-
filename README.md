# Interactive 3D Image Carousel

This project creates an interactive 3D image carousel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with GSAP for smooth animations. Users can interact with the carousel, dragging to rotate around a 3D ring of images. Hovering over images adjusts their opacity, emphasizing the image under the cursor.

## Features

- 3D rotating carousel of images.
- Interactive drag to rotate functionality.
- Hover effects to highlight images.
- Fully responsive design.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

## Usage

- Click and drag horizontally anywhere on the carousel to rotate the images.
- Hover over any image to bring it into focus while dimming the others.
- Release the mouse or touch to stop the rotation.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The `index.html` contains the structure of the image carousel, including placeholders for images and links for additional resources like CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

### CSS

`style.css` provides the styling required to position and display the carousel in 3D space, as well as animation effects.

### JavaScript

`script.js` uses GSAP to create the interactive animations that enable the carousel's rotation and hover effects. It includes functions for dragging and calculating the rotation of the carousel, as well as for setting up initial states.
